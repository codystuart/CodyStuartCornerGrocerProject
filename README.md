# CodyStuartCornerGrocerProject

## Problem Solved
This project is intended to assist the Corner Grocer company with visualizing and monitoring sales of produce. 
Based on an ingested file that reads produce sold for the day it allows the user to query for the frequency of sales for a specific product, or all products.
This program also allows for the user to visualize the frequency with a histogram

## What was done well
For this particular program I was happy with how I processed my way through the project. I started by completing all of the required functionality for the project in main
I then went and broke the project out into classes. It really helped me to have the project completely functioning to understand how it should have been seperated.

## Where could the code be enhanced
The code itself could have a real UI rather than being a text based application completely. As for the code itself. I would have liked to have cleared the screen with each prompt of the main menu and with each display of the resulting selection.
This improvement would have made the visibility of each function clearer.

## Challenges
I found some difficulty with utilizing the map at first. However I did use [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-associative-containers-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/) and [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_maps.asp)
With the information at these links on how to use Maps in C++ I was able to confidently Create Maps, assign key, value pairs and traverse maps in this program.

## Transferable skills
I feel as if for this project transferrable skills will be the formatting and validation of code applied throughout this program. I took the time to conform my code to a style for functions, variables, etc. As well as researching different types of input validation based on what it was that I was trying to accomplish.

## Maintable, Readable, Adaptable
The codes maintainability has been improved with the readability and modularity.
I made this program readable by conforming to a style guide based heavily on the Google Style guide.
The program is adaptable thanks to the classes that I have seperated out, one class is focusing on the functionality of the user and the other class focuses on the reading and writing and files and managing the main menu selections and exiting.
I didn't implement any specific design patterns, but I made an effort to use the following Object Oriented Programming Principles
- Single responsibility principle
- Error Handling
- Data Abstraction
- Auto Iterator Patterns
